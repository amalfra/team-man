​A ​simple frontend ​only ​team-member ​management ​application in reactjs built using redux, react-hook-form and semantic ui. The app has 3 pages:
* list page: where all team members will be listed
* add page: where new team member can be added
* edit page: where existing team member details can be modified

![list-page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amalfra/team-man/main/.images/list-page.png)
![add-page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amalfra/team-man/main/.images/add-page.png)
![edit-page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amalfra/team-man/main/.images/edit-page.png)

## Usage
* First run ```npm i``` to setup required dependencies.
* Then run ```npm run start:dev``` or ```npm run start:prod```. This will compile and concat ES6 js file and start static serving server for the app.

The code is written in simplest way without much bloat so that even begineers can easily understand. This might not probably be the best structure/organization of files for large projects but could possibly help begineers of react and redux to get started without much searching and referring multiple tutorials.
